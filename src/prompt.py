Now, when you run the tests using the `python test_expense_tracker.py` command, the menu should not be displayed, and the tests should run without any interruption.\n\nIf you want to run the main program, you can simply execute `python expense_tracker.py` as usual, and the menu will be displayed.\n\nBy separating the main program logic from the module-level code, we can ensure that the tests run cleanly without any interference from the main program loop.',

Let's move on to Task 7: Document the project.\n\nDocumentation is an essential part of any software project, as it helps other developers (or your future self) understand the purpose, usage, and implementation details of the code.\n\n1. Open the `README.md` file and add the following sections:\n\n```markdown\n# Expense Tracker\n\nA simple command-line application to track personal expenses.\n\n## Features\n\n- Add new expenses with date, description, category, and amount\n- List all expenses in a tabular format, sorted by date\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.\n2. Clone or download the project repository.\n3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.\n4. Run the application with the following command:\n\n```\npython expense_tracker.py\n```\n\n5. Follow the interactive menu to add expenses or list existing expenses.\n\n## File Structure\n\n- `expense_tracker.py`: The main script file containing the application logic.\n- `test_expense_tracker.py`: Unit tests for the expense tracker application.\n- `expenses.csv`: The default CSV file used to store expense data.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis project uses the following Python modules:\n\n- `csv`: Built-in module for reading and writing CSV files.\n- `datetime`: Built-in module for working with dates and times.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n```\n\n2. Create a `LICENSE` file in the project directory and add the MIT License text. You can find the license text at [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n3. Optionally, you can add docstrings to the functions in `expense_tracker.py` to provide more detailed documentation about their purpose, parameters, and return values. For example:\n\n```python\ndef load_expenses(file_path='expenses.csv'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Load expenses from a CSV file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str, optional): The path to the CSV file. Defaults to 'expenses.csv'.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an expense.\n    \"\"\"\n    expenses = []\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n            expenses = list(reader)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n    return expenses\n```\n\nBy adding docstrings, you can generate documentation using tools like `pydoc` or `sphinx`.\n\nThat's it! You now have a well-documented expense tracker project with a README file explaining the project structure, usage, and contributing guidelines, as well as a license file.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to review or clarify anything.",
